            <p class="bh">What is the best way to write a resume?</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p class="bp" style="text-align: justify;">To entice a recruiter to meet you, your CV must clearly, simply, and strategically portray your qualifications. It should highlight your qualifications, employment experience, and assets. The resume is designed to explain your professional accomplishments while also demonstrating what you can do for an employer. Unexpected job chances can develop. A successful job search requires an updated current resume. Here are some tips on how to make a strong CV and what information to include. Maintain a clean and simple resume. A resume is skimmed in 30 seconds on average by an employer. You want them to see that you are qualified for the job right away. Check your resume for errors several times. Make certain there are no errors in spelling or punctuation. Have someone else go through it with you. A simple spelling error on a resume can give the employer the wrong impression. It might even keep you from getting hired. Keep your resume to two pages maximum. Make your most recent experience the focal point of your CV. Jobs and experience that are older than 15 years should be eliminated or curtailed. This allows the employer to concentrate on more pertinent facts. Make your resume specific to the job you're applying for. Include any relevant work experience or accomplishments for the position you're applying for. Examine the job description or the employer's website to do so. Highlight your accomplishments. You want to be able to pinpoint the most effective examples of your abilities. These examples should reflect what you accomplished in your role and what kind of employee you are. This information should be included in the resume's "Work experience" section. Be truthful. It is never a good idea to lie on your CV. You don't want to lie to the employer by exaggerating your abilities or results. Calculate your accomplishments. Use precise figures that the employer will comprehend and admire. For instance, how many employees did you manage, how many things did you sell, and by what percentage did sales increase? Simple words and action verbs should be used. It's possible that the individual examining your CV isn't the employer. Recruiters and Human Resources professionals who are unfamiliar with your area may check your resume. Use straightforward language, as well as compelling verbs like handled, managed, led, developed, increased, completed, leveraged, and so on. Include volunteer work that demonstrates your abilities. Put it on your resume if you have volunteered for a well-known organisation or worked for a worthwhile cause. These experiences should be listed under "Work experience" or "Volunteer work," especially if they are relevant to the position you are applying for. Your name, address, email, and phone number should all be listed on your resume. This information belongs at the top of the first page. Also, double-check that this information is correct. The employer will not be able to reach you otherwise.</p>

            <p class="bh">What’s the Difference Between a Résumé and a CV?</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p class="bp" style="text-align: justify;">Preparing a summary of work experience and skills is a critical part of the job-seeking process. But for young job seekers, fresh out of high school, college, or postgraduate programs, one of the first obstacles encountered is whether you should prepare a résumé or a CV. But what is the difference between the two, and why does it matter when applying for a job?
              The term résumé comes from the French résumer, meaning “to summarize,” while CV is an abbreviation for the Latin curriculum vitae, meaning “course of (one’s) life.” Hence, the biggest difference between a résumé and a CV is length. A résumé provides a concise overview of one’s education, work experience, credentials, and relevant skills, typically fit to a single page. A CV on the other hand often is multiple pages in length and presents a detailed summary of academic background and degrees, job experience, research, publications, presentations and lectures, honors, and other accomplishments.
              Résumés and CVs also differ in that the former usually is tailored to the specific job of interest. A résumé generally features only the experience and skills that relate directly to the job description. A CV may be tailored to a minor extent, such as by highlighting specific skills relevant to the job, but otherwise requires little editing or fine-tuning from one job application to next. CVs simply grow over time as new publications, skills, and achievements are added to the document.
              In addition, CVs generally are favored in academia and are used almost exclusively when applying for almost any job in a country other than Canada or the United States. In many cases, companies, schools, or other institutions that are recruiting new employees are clear about which type of document they prefer, eliminating much of the guesswork for applicants.</p>
