            <h4 style="font-family: Arial;color:blue;font-weight: bold;" >How <b>RESUME FREEMIUM</b> CAME?</h4>
            <h6>
              This project never gets completed and we will never be able to give you the power to create a resume for free. If there had not been any misunderstanding between two friends, then perhaps you would never have come to this page and never would have made your resume. In starting we got a college project. We had to work on it. together but when there were a few days of completing the project. Mr. Juned fired me from the project. You didn't think he could build the project himself.  They didn't need me so they kicked me out of that project.  Now the same project for which 6 months are given to make it.  I had only a few days left to make that project, so I didn't have any idea.  I was thinking how I will be able to complete a 6 month project in a few days.  I didn't even know what I would make? Then my colleague Mr. Deepak gave me the idea that if you want to make something.  If you want to make some product, then first of all you have to keep in mind the needs of the people.  What is the problem of people? From there it came to my mind that why not make such a project so that I can help people online and that's how Resume Freemium came into the world.
